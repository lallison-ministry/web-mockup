								<p>There are moments when heaven seems to touch earth, when you know, without a doubt, that God is near. For our team, one such moment unfolded towards the end of March during a ministry trip to Kajiado County, nestled in the semi-arid heartland of Kenya. A part of our team was invited to train a group of church women at a local conference, and what began as a teaching assignment quickly turned into a sacred encounter with the presence of God.</p>
								<p>We came prepared with outlines, scriptures, and notes, ready to teach on topics that have long been on our hearts: <strong>Identity in Christ, Inner Healing and Forgiveness, Freedom from the Pain of Loss, Trauma, Abuse, </strong>and <strong>Rejection, and Deliverance from Curses</strong>, including those tied to the land. But nothing could have fully prepared us for the hunger for God and freedom we encountered in that place or the healing that would unfold in its wake.</p>
								<p>From the very first session, there was an undeniable spiritual pull in the atmosphere. You could sense the openness, the yearning for something more than just information. These women didn’t come for another church program, they came with hearts wide open, ready to receive from the Lord.</p>
								<p>Teaching on the topics that stir emotions and deep introspection is never light work.. It calls people to remember, to confront, to release. But in that safe, Spirit-filled space, healing began to take root. You could almost feel chains falling as people laid down their burdens, burdens that they had carried for long, at the feet of Jesus. Silent tears became testimonies of freedom. And one by one, hearts began to bloom again.</p>
								<p>A powerful moment that still echoes in our hearts was when Bishop Siminkor led the congregation in renouncing spoken curses over the land. It was more than symbolic; it was spiritual warfare wrapped in prayer and authority. As voices rose in unity, declaring freedom over their land and lives, it felt like something broke open in the spirit. There was a breakthrough; tangible, palpable, and deeply moving.</p>
								<p>One thing that deeply touched us was the warmth of the community. Despite their daily responsibilities; like ensuring cattle are out to pasture before attending any event; the women came faithfully. Their resilience, discipline, and hunger were humbling. It was also a gentle reminder that ministry is never “one size fits all.” Culture matters. Context matters. And the more we lean in to understand, the more meaningful our connection becomes.</p>
								<blockquote>We left Kajiado changed not just because we witnessed healing, but because we saw God moving in a way that reminded us why we do what we do. This isn’t just ministry. This is life. This is legacy. And this is love in action.</blockquote>
								<p>The good news? This is just the beginning. Conversations have already begun about extending the training to men and youth in the region. The seeds have been planted. The ground has been tilled. And now we wait in hope, watching for what God will do next.</p>

                <blockquote>“Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples!” – Psalm 96:3 (ESV)</blockquote>
								<p>“I recently had the incredible opportunity to travel to Uganda for a mission and let me just say, it was the longest journey I’ve ever been on! We were on the road for so many hours that at some point, we literally stopped and slept on the bus. Yes, you read that right bus naps were part of the itinerary!</p>
                <p>As we crossed into Uganda, I noticed something that instantly made me smile, the hawkers. Now, these guys are not what we are used to back home. These guys weren’t offering the usual soda or biscuits. No, they were selling real roasted chicken on sticks. And they’d walk right up to the bus windows like it was drive-through dining on wheels. I couldn’t help but laugh, it was such a unique Ugandan experience and honestly, I loved it.</p>
                <p>Our destination was Arua, nestled in the northern part of the country. From the very first “Welcome!” spoken by the locals; with such sincerity and warmth,we felt at home. That word became the anthem of our time there. Welcome. It was more than hospitality; it was heart.</p>
                <p>The food was hearty, the portions generous, and the flavors bold; every meal felt like a celebration. The culture was equally generous. </p>
                <p>During our sessions, I had the humbling opportunity to teach and encourage others in their faith. Standing in front of a room full of eager hearts, I was reminded again and again: it’s not about having the perfect words, it’s about availability. God does something sacred when you simply show up.</p>
                <p>But perhaps the wildest moment of the trip? Ministering live on a radio broadcast. Whew. Imagine sitting in a studio, mic in front of you, heart thudding in your chest, knowing your voice is going out to thousands, maybe more. That moment was surreal; a mix of nerves, joy, and deep fulfillment. I shared the Word, but more than that, I felt the weight of being a vessel. That moment? Seared into my memory.</p>
                <p>If this trip taught me anything, it’s this: Mission isn’t always about preaching from pulpits. Sometimes, it’s found in quiet prayers whispered over meals, in listening intently to a young girl share her dreams, or in dancing with elders during a community gathering.</p>
                <p>It’s about presence. Sacred, undistracted, fully-present presence. It’s learning to listen deeply, to notice what’s unsaid, to see the divine in the daily.</p>
                <p>Jesus didn’t just preach in synagogues, He walked dusty roads, He ate with sinners, He touched the untouchable. That’s the kind of mission we were invited into in Uganda. One that looks people in the eye, holds their stories with care, and offers hope without needing a spotlight.</p>
                <p>As I look back on our journey; bus naps, chicken sticks, soulful sessions, and all. I carry with me a deeper appreciation for the body of Christ across borders. There is beauty in diversity, strength in unity, and grace in every encounter.</p>
                <blockquote><strong>“Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples!” – Psalm 96:3 (ESV)</strong></blockquote>
                <p>Uganda, thank you for the lessons, the laughter, and the unforgettable memories. Until next time.”</p>
